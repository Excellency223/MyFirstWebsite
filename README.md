This is my very first HTML project — a simple *Hello World* website created while learning Frontend Web Development.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to set up VS Code  
- How to use Live Server  
- How to write my first HTML file  
- How to upload a project to GitHub  

## 🚀 About This Journey
I'm currently learning Frontend Web Development and documenting my progress daily on LinkedIn.  
You can follow my journey there too!
